1) Project structure
	
	main.c -> Basic project setup. Parses the command and manages processes. It also contain signal handling for background processes.
	executioner.c -> Implements Piping and forking for new processes background signal processing.

- Portuguese docs for most of the functions and commands
- Makefile to compile
- Doxygen to generate documentation

4) Testing

There are three programs to test CRASH. You can find them in the "teste" folder, and
after compiling the project with make, those tests are also compiled and available in the /bin folder,
along with CRASH's binary.

	test_output -> Test parameter handling
	test_utillib -> Test utility library
	laco -> Tight loop to test background execution and multi process maangement.

5) Docs

All the source files in the /src folder are documented in portuguese. You can generate
